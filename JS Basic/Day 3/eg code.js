// let a=10;
// console.log(a); : this will give us the output as - 10

// let a=10;
// console.log(a);
// let a; : if we are typing this only, then it will give us the 'Reference Error', as it has not yet been initialised

// b=10;
// console.log(b);
// var b; : this will also work, by giving the output - 10

// console.log(c);
// var c=10; : this will give us as undefined

// console.log(d);
// const d=10; - this will also give us the Reference Error as the constant d, has not yet been initialised

// const e = 129312;
// console.log(e); : this will give us the output successfully as - 129312

// const e;
// console.log(e);
// e = 12312; : This will give us the SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

// This is how Hoisting works in JS. We have to put the declarations and the initialisations in the top scope.
