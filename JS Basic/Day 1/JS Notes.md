# JavaScript was made with the purpose of running this language on the client side or on the browser.

# How does the 3 work together :
1) How things are coming on your code is coming from HTML.
2) How things are being designed is coming from CSS.
3) How things are behaving or functioning is coming from JS.

# What is a script ?
A script is a set of instructions that a computer or a system follows in order to execute something.
Through this, we can run any behavior on the browser.

1) Scripting languages are commonly used for tasks such as system administration, web development, text processing and automation.

2) Scripting languages are interpreted within a host environment; for instance, JavaScript needs to be integrated into HTML and then interpreted by the web browser.

Through JS, we can run these scripts, in the browser itself, for which brings on the purpose of the JS in the picture.

Thus, we can also say that JS is a integrated language or we can say a lightweight language

# How was Node introduced through JS ?
Node came when a developer by the name - 'Brenden' brought the features of JS into C++, to handle the backend work.

What we were doing earlier was, we were only running things on the client side, now with Node introduced in the picture, we can now actually run these things on the server side or on the backend now.

# What is JavaScript
JS is a lightweight or a scripting language through which we can make games, we can make CLI tools, web apps, mobile tools.
