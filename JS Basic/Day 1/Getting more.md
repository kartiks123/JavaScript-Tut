# ECMA, ES6, ES13 ??
ECMA script is a standard, which is used as a consistency so that there is uniformity in the behavior of JS we are using the features of.
Thus it is an implementation of that language, made standard throughout the JS community.

JS was initially named, 'Mocha'. Then it was named 'LiveScript'.

# JS Engines

The browsers that we want our web apps to run on, should have a JS engine installed within themselves. 
Google has V8, Mozilla Firefox has Spider Monkey, Edge has Chakra, Safari has JS Core Webkit.
